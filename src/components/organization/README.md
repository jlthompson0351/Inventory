## Usage Guidelines

1. Each tab component is designed to be used within a tabbed interface (typically using shadcn UI's Tabs component)
2. Access control should be implemented at the parent component level to determine which tabs to show
3. The debugging panels are meant for system administrators and super administrators only

## Access Control Hierarchy

The components follow this access control hierarchy:

1. **All Users**: GeneralSettingsTab
2. **Organization Admins**: AdminSettingsTab
3. **Super Admins**: AdminDebugPanel, SuperAdminDebugTab

## Error Handling

All components now implement comprehensive error handling with:

- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Loading states during asynchronous operations

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements for the organization components:

1. Add more diagnostic tools to the admin panels
2. Implement organization analytics dashboard
3. Add user invitation management interface
4. Enhance permission management for different user roles
