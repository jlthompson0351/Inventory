# Supabase Data Model (Updated August 2025)

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the Supabase PostgreSQL schema for the BarcodEx inventory management system. It covers all major tables, relationships, and is intended to be the single source of truth for the database schema.

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture**

### **Multi-Tenancy**
-   **Organization-Scoped**: Every table containing business data has an `organization_id` column to ensure data isolation.
-   **RLS-Enforced**: Row-Level Security policies are applied to every table to automatically filter data based on the user's organization. See `SUPABASE-SECURITY.md` for a full breakdown of RLS policies.

### **Performance Infrastructure**
-   **Indexes**: Key foreign key columns, text search fields, and frequently queried columns are indexed for performance.
-   **Database Functions (RPCs)**: Complex business logic is encapsulated in PostgreSQL functions for performance and reusability.
