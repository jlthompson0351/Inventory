# Inventory Workflow Plan (Updated August 2025)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & PRODUCTION-READY**

This document outlines the architecture and features of the BarcodEx inventory management workflow. All core features are operational and deployed.

---

## üéØ **Core Architecture**

-   **One-to-One Asset-Inventory Relationship**: Each `Asset` has a single corresponding `inventory_items` record, ensuring a clear and simple data model.
-   **Form-Driven Workflow**: `Asset Types` are linked to dynamic forms, allowing for customized data collection for different categories of assets.
-   **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Every inventory event (intake, audit, adjustment) is recorded in the `inventory_history` table, providing a complete, auditable history of all changes.
-   **Mobile-First QR Workflow**: A secure, PIN-based workflow allows for efficient inventory management in the field using mobile devices.

## üì¶ **Key Features & Implementation**

### **Automatic Inventory Creation**
-   When a new `Asset` is created, a corresponding `inventory_items` record is automatically generated.
-   An initial `inventory_history` record is created with `event_type = 'intake'`.
-   **Key Component**: `src/services/inventoryService.ts` - `createAssetWithInitialInventory`

### **Smart User Interface**
-   **Asset List**: The main asset list displays real-time inventory indicators, including:
    -   Stock quantity
    -   "Freshness" of the last update (e.g., "updated hours ago")
    -   Low stock and out-of-stock warnings.
-   **Contextual Buttons**: The UI provides smart buttons ("View History", "Edit Inventory", "Add Inventory") that adapt based on whether an asset already has an inventory record.
-   **Key Component**: `src/components/inventory/AssetList.tsx`

### **Dynamic Form Handling**
-   The system intelligently loads the correct inventory form based on the `Asset Type`.
-   If an asset type does not have a specific inventory form assigned, a fallback form with basic fields (quantity, location, condition) is provided.
-   **Key Component**: `src/pages/AddInventoryForAssetPage.tsx`

### **Mobile QR Workflow**
-   **Anonymous Access**: Users can scan a QR code and view basic asset information without a full login.
-   **PIN Authentication**: A 4-digit PIN is required to perform any inventory actions, ensuring security in the field.
-   **Seamless Experience**: The system seamlessly handles both standard and PIN-based authenticated sessions.
-   **Key Component**: `src/pages/MobileAssetWorkflow.tsx`

## üóÑÔ∏è **Data Model**

-   **`assets`**: The core table for physical assets.
-   **`inventory_items`**: The table for tracking the current state (e.g., quantity, location) of an asset.
-   **`inventory_history`**: The audit log for all inventory changes.
-   **`forms` & `form_submissions`**: The dynamic forms system that powers the data collection.

## üöÄ **Production Status**

The inventory workflow is fully implemented, tested, and deployed. It is a robust, enterprise-ready system that provides a comprehensive solution for asset and inventory management, including a powerful mobile workflow for field operations.
