# Supabase Security: RLS Policies (Updated August 2025)

**Status**: üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED**

This document provides a complete and accurate overview of the Row-Level Security (RLS) policies implemented in the BarcodEx Supabase backend. It is intended to be the single source of truth for all data access rules.

---

## üö® **CRITICAL ALERT: Insecure Anonymous Access**

As of the latest review, several tables contain RLS policies that grant excessive permissions to anonymous users. These policies create **critical security vulnerabilities** that could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, and deletion across all organizations.

**This is not a theoretical risk. The current policies actively expose your data.**

##  remediation Plan

The insecure RLS policies for anonymous users must be **removed and replaced immediately**. The mobile QR workflow needs to be redesigned to use a secure authentication method, such as a short-lived session token obtained through a secure RPC call.

Refer to `docs/MOBILE-QR-PIN-WORKFLOW.md` for a detailed remediation plan.
