# Supabase Security: RLS Policies (Updated January 2025)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SECURE AND PRODUCTION READY**

This document provides a complete and accurate overview of the Row-Level Security (RLS) policies implemented in the BarcodEx Supabase backend. The system implements a comprehensive security model with organization-based isolation and secure mobile QR workflow.

---

## üîê **Security Architecture Overview**

**Current Status**: 140+ RLS policies across 35 tables
**Security Model**: Multi-tenant organization isolation with mobile QR support
**Authentication**: Traditional auth + PIN-based mobile QR with session management
**Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all access and modifications

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**

### **Multi-Tenant Organization Isolation**
- Every business table enforces organization-based access control
- Complete data separation between organizations
- No cross-organization data leakage possible

### **Mobile QR Security Model**
- Anonymous access policies are specifically designed for mobile QR workflow
- Protected by PIN authentication and session token validation  
- Time-limited sessions with automatic cleanup
- Comprehensive audit trail via `mobile_debug_logs` and `qr_scan_sessions`

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- Granular permissions: admin, manager, editor, member roles
- Organization-scoped role enforcement
- Platform operators for system-wide administration

## üîí **RLS Policy Categories**

### **1. Organization-Based Policies (Primary Security Layer)**
Most business tables enforce organization isolation:

```sql
-- Example pattern used across all business tables
(organization_id = get_current_organization_id())

-- Alternative pattern for user-scoped organization access
(organization_id IN (
  SELECT organization_members.organization_id 
  FROM organization_members 
  WHERE organization_members.user_id = auth.uid()
))
```

**Tables with Organization-Based RLS:**
- `assets`, `asset_types`, `inventory_items`, `inventory_history`
- `forms`, `form_submissions`, `form_responses`  
- `reports`, `system_logs`, `background_jobs`
- All formula and mapping tables

### **2. Mobile QR Anonymous Access Policies**
Secure anonymous access for mobile QR workflow:

**Assets Table Example:**
- `Allow anonymous mobile QR access to assets` (SELECT) - Controlled by session validation
- `Allow anonymous update to assets for mobile QR` (UPDATE) - Protected by PIN authentication

**Security Controls:**
- Session tokens via `qr_scan_sessions` table with expiration
- PIN authentication through `authenticate_mobile_pin()` function
- Comprehensive audit logging in `mobile_debug_logs`
- Geographic and temporal access restrictions

### **3. Role-Based Administrative Policies**
Enhanced permissions for administrators and managers:

**Example Patterns:**
```sql
-- Organization admin check
((organization_id = get_current_organization_id()) AND is_org_admin(organization_id))

-- Manager/editor roles
((organization_id = get_current_organization_id()) AND 
 (is_org_admin(organization_id) OR 
  (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM organization_members om 
           WHERE om.user_id = auth.uid() 
           AND om.organization_id = table.organization_id 
           AND om.role = ANY (ARRAY['manager'::text, 'editor'::text])))))
```

### **4. Platform Operator Policies**
System-wide administrative access:

```sql
-- Platform operators can access all organizations
(EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM platform_operators 
         WHERE platform_operators.user_id = auth.uid()))
```

### **5. Self-Service Policies** 
Users managing their own data:

```sql
-- Users can update their own profiles
(auth.uid() = user_id)

-- Users can view their own data
(auth.uid() = id)
```

## üîç **Security Validation & Monitoring**

### **Database Function Security**
Key security functions protecting the system:

- `get_current_organization_id()`: Ensures organization context
- `is_org_admin()`, `is_org_member()`: Role validation
- `authenticate_mobile_pin()`: Mobile QR authentication
- `validate_qr_scan_session()`: Session token validation
- `cleanup_expired_qr_sessions()`: Automatic session cleanup

### **Audit Trail & Monitoring**
Complete audit capabilities:

- `system_logs`: All system activities logged with organization context
- `mobile_debug_logs`: Mobile QR workflow debugging and security monitoring
- `qr_scan_sessions`: Active session tracking with IP and user agent
- `inventory_transactions`: Complete transaction logging
- `inventory_history.edit_history`: Edit tracking for corrections

### **Security Testing Results**
‚úÖ **Organization Isolation**: Verified - no cross-organization data access
‚úÖ **Mobile QR Security**: PIN authentication + session tokens working correctly
‚úÖ **Role-Based Access**: Admin/manager/editor/member roles enforced properly
‚úÖ **Anonymous Access**: Limited to mobile QR workflow with proper controls
‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all security-relevant events

## üöÄ **Production Security Status**

**Overall Assessment**: ‚úÖ **SECURE AND PRODUCTION READY**

The RLS implementation provides enterprise-grade security with:
- Complete multi-tenant data isolation
- Secure mobile workflow with proper authentication
- Comprehensive audit trail and monitoring
- Role-based access control with proper escalation
- Platform administration capabilities for system management

The anonymous access policies are **intentional and secure**, designed specifically for the mobile QR workflow with proper authentication and session management controls in place.
