## üîß **Environment Configuration**

-   **Production**: Your production environment is configured in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` with secure fallbacks.
-   **Local Development**: Use a `.env.local` file to override the production Supabase URL and anon key for local testing.

## üöÄ **Deployment Workflow**

### **Automated Deployment (Recommended)**
-   **Trigger**: A push to the `main` branch on GitHub.
-   **Process**: GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the application.
-   **URL**: **https://inventorydepor.web.app**

### **Manual Deployment**
1.  `npm run build`

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

-   **Deployment Fails**: Run `firebase login` and ensure you have access to the `inventorydepor` project.
