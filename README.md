## Development

### Generating Supabase Types

To update TypeScript definitions from your Supabase schema:

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/types/database.types.ts
```

### Running Database Migrations

The system includes advanced database optimizations. To apply performance migrations:

1. Use Supabase Dashboard or CLI
2. Apply migrations in the `supabase/migrations` folder
3. Run maintenance functions: `SELECT run_reporting_maintenance();`
