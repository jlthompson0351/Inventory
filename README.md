## Major Features

### ðŸš€ Enterprise Reporting System

The latest addition is a world-class reporting system with:

- **Sub-second Performance**: Queries that previously took 3-5 seconds now complete in 200-500ms
- **Advanced Filtering**: 14 operators including regex, fuzzy matching, and between ranges
- **Real-time Preview**: Auto-updating report preview with 800ms debouncing
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent LRU cache with 50MB memory management
- **Performance Monitoring**: Live execution statistics and optimization recommendations
- **Parallel Processing**: Process up to 3 data sources simultaneously
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed aggregations for instant results

For detailed documentation, see [Optimized Reporting System](./docs/OPTIMIZED-REPORTING-SYSTEM.md).

### Form Builder

The Form Builder allows users to create dynamic forms with various field types including:
- Text fields
- Number fields
- Dropdowns
- Checkboxes
- Radio buttons
- Formula fields (with mathematical expressions)
- File upload fields

Forms can include conditional logic to show/hide fields based on user input.

### Formula Evaluator

The built-in formula evaluator allows for safe evaluation of mathematical expressions:

- Supports basic operations: +, -, *, /, %, ^
- Supports functions: min, max, abs, round, floor, ceil, sqrt, pow
- Variables can reference other fields in the form
- Secure implementation without using eval() or Function()

### Asset Management

- Create and manage asset types with barcode/QR code generation
- Define custom forms for each asset type
- Track assets with customizable fields
- Generate reports on asset status and inventory
- Parent-child relationships for complex equipment
- Price history tracking for financial reporting

### Organization Management

- Users belong to a single organization
- System administrators can view and manage all organizations
- Manage user roles (e.g., admin, member) and permissions within their organization
- Advanced diagnostic tools for system monitoring

## Development

### Generating Supabase Types

To update TypeScript definitions from your Supabase schema:

```
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/types/database.types.ts
```

### Running Database Migrations

The system includes advanced database optimizations. To apply performance migrations:

1. Use Supabase Dashboard or CLI
2. Apply migrations in the `supabase/migrations` folder
3. Run maintenance functions: `SELECT run_reporting_maintenance();`
