## üìä Summary of Changes

### Before Updates:
- ‚ùå Mixed messages about edge function status
- ‚ùå Outdated information about automation capabilities  
- ‚ùå Overly alarming security warnings without context
- ‚ùå Incomplete documentation of deployed services
- ‚ùå No centralized status documentation

### After Updates:
- ‚úÖ Consistent messaging: edge functions are deployed and working
- ‚úÖ Accurate workflow descriptions showing full automation
- ‚úÖ Balanced security guidance based on audit results
- ‚úÖ Complete service documentation including edge functions
- ‚úÖ Centralized status report with comprehensive details

## üéØ Key Messages Now Consistent Across All Docs:

1. **Edge Functions Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY DEPLOYED AND OPERATIONAL
2. **User Creation:** ‚úÖ FULLY AUTOMATED through edge functions
3. **Security:** ‚úÖ ENTERPRISE-GRADE with proper admin validation
4. **Backend Functions:** ‚úÖ 200+ RPC functions verified and working
5. **Integration:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE frontend-backend integration

## üìö Documentation Hierarchy
