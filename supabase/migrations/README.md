## Migration Best Practices

1. **Testing**: Always test migrations in a development environment before applying to production
2. **Backups**: Take a database backup before applying migrations
3. **Versioning**: Use date prefixes (YYYYMMDD) for migration files to maintain order
4. **Documentation**: Keep this README updated with new migrations
5. **Dependencies**: List any dependencies between migrations

## Applying Migrations

Migrations are applied automatically during Supabase deployment. To apply migrations manually:

```bash
supabase db push
```

To reset and reapply all migrations:

```bash
supabase db reset
```
