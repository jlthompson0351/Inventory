## Benefits of Single-Org Model

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed complex multi-org logic
2. **Better Performance**: No need to filter by organization in every query
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Simpler permission model
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Less code to maintain
5. **Clear Data Boundaries**: Each deployment is for one organization

## Recommendations

1. **Update Documentation**: Remove any references to multi-organization features
2. **Update User Guides**: Simplify onboarding without org selection
3. **Clean Up UI**: Remove any remaining org-switching UI elements
4. **Optimize Queries**: Remove organization filters where no longer needed
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all features work in single-org context

## Migration Verified
All multi-organization remnants have been successfully removed. The system now operates in pure single-organization mode.
