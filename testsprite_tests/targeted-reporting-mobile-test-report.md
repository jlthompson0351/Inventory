# üéØ Targeted TestSprite Report: Reporting & Mobile QR Inventory

---

## üìä **Focused Test Results: 0/3 PASSED**

**Test Focus**: Reporting systems and mobile QR inventory workflows  
**Tests Run**: 3 specific feature tests  
**Critical Issues Found**: 2 major backend problems, 1 UI limitation

---

## üö® **CRITICAL FINDINGS**

### **1. Mobile QR Inventory Completely Broken** ‚ùå
- **Test ID:** TC012 - Mobile QR Code Scanning with PIN Authentication
- **Issue:** **404 Error** - Route `/inventory/check/{id}` does not exist
- **Impact:** **Mobile QR workflow is completely inaccessible**
- **Error:** `User attempted to access non-existent route: /inventory/check/18cd2610-a885-4ff0-9635-aa9545878e64`
- **Severity:** **HIGH PRIORITY**

**What this means**: When users scan QR codes and try to do inventory checks, the app crashes with a 404 error.

### **2. Dashboard Data Broken** ‚ùå  
- **Test ID:** TC015 - Real-time Dashboard Update and Data Accuracy
- **Issue:** **Database schema mismatch** - Column `assets.asset_id` does not exist
- **Impact:** **Dashboard cannot load asset data, reporting fails**
- **Error:** `Supabase error: column assets.asset_id does not exist`
- **Severity:** **HIGH PRIORITY**

**What this means**: Your dashboard and reporting can't show asset information because the database query is looking for a column that doesn't exist.

### **3. Avatar Upload Limitation** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Test ID:** TC016 - User Profile Management and Avatar Upload  
- **Issue:** File input element doesn't support file upload in test environment
- **Impact:** Cannot validate avatar upload functionality
- **Severity:** **MEDIUM** (testing limitation, may work in real use)

## üîß **Immediate Fixes Needed**

### **Fix 1: Mobile QR Route (URGENT)**
```typescript
// Missing route in your React Router configuration
// Need to add in src/App.tsx or routing file:
<Route path="/inventory/check/:id" element={<InventoryCheckPage />} />
```

**Check these files:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Main routing configuration
- `src/pages/` - Look for InventoryCheck or similar component
- Verify the "Check" button in inventory management links to correct route

### **Fix 2: Database Schema Issue (URGENT)**  
```sql
-- Either add the missing column:
ALTER TABLE assets ADD COLUMN asset_id VARCHAR;

-- OR fix the frontend query to use existing column (likely 'id'):
-- Change frontend from: assets.asset_id 
-- To: assets.id
```

**Check these files:**
- `src/services/assetService.ts` - Look for QR code asset queries
- Search codebase for `asset_id` vs `id` usage inconsistency

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Fix TestSprite Test Selection**

You asked how to control what TestSprite tests - here's exactly how:

### **Method 1: Specific Test IDs** (What I just used)
```typescript
// Test only reporting features:
testIds: ["TC015", "TC016", "TC020"] 

// Test only mobile QR workflow:
testIds: ["TC012", "TC009", "TC005"]

// Test only inventory management:
testIds: ["TC010", "TC011", "TC008"]
```

### **Method 2: Custom Instructions**
```typescript
additionalInstruction: "FOCUS ONLY ON: Mobile QR scanning workflow, Advanced reporting with charts, Real-time dashboard. IGNORE: Authentication, organization management, profile settings."
```

### **Method 3: Update Your Documentation**
Create a file like `TESTSPRITE_FOCUS.md`:
```markdown
# TestSprite Focus Areas

## Priority 1 - Mobile QR Workflow
- QR code scanning with camera
- PIN authentication flow  
- Inventory check-in/check-out
- Mobile-responsive forms

## Priority 2 - Reporting System
- Advanced report generation
- Data visualization with charts
- Performance and caching
- Export functionality

## Priority 3 - Dashboard
- Real-time statistics
- Live data updates
- Interactive charts
```

## üìà **What This Test Revealed**

### **Good News**: 
- TestSprite can successfully target specific features
- It found real, actionable bugs in your mobile and reporting systems
- The issues are specific and fixable

### **Bad News**:
- Your mobile QR inventory feature is completely broken (404 route)
- Dashboard/reporting has a database schema problem
- These are production-blocking issues

---

## üéØ **Next Steps**

### **Immediate (Today)**:
1. **Fix the missing route** `/inventory/check/{id}` - this is breaking mobile QR workflow
2. **Fix the database query** for `assets.asset_id` vs `assets.id` 

### **Testing Strategy**:
1. **After fixes**: Re-run the same targeted test to verify fixes work
2. **Expand testing**: Use `testIds` to focus on specific feature areas you care about
3. **Create focus docs**: Write `TESTSPRITE_PRIORITIES.md` to guide future testing

### **For Better Reporting Tests**:
```typescript
// Run this after you fix the schema issue:
testIds: ["TC015", "TC016", "TC020", "TC021"] // All reporting & performance tests
```

**The key insight**: TestSprite found real bugs that would affect your users. These targeted tests are much more valuable than comprehensive testing because they focus on features you actually care about.
